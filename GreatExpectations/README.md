# Validation, Documentation, and Profiling with Great Expections

Great Expectations is a Python package designed for data validation, documentation, and profiling.
It allows users to define expectations—verifiable assertions about data quality—and automatically generate tests to ensure datasets meet these expectations.

Additionally, it provides tools for creating detailed reports and documentation, helping teams maintain data quality and communicate effectively across technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Instructions
This activity uses Python and JupyterLab on our Analytics Research Cluster.
1. Navigate to  http://10.230.100.236:8000 and login with a guest login.
2. Clone the repository from https://github.com/molnarai/data-management-and-governance-hands-on 
3. Follow the steps in the tutorial https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/core/connect_to_data/dataframes 

## Notes
- This activity demonstrates how to implement data quality monitoring into the ETL pipeline.
- This example uses CSV files and Pandas. Though, the library also supports production level data sources.
- The tutorial uses a part of the NYC Taxi dataset. Feel free to explore other data.
